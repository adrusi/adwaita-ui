# Adwaita UI
Adwaita is the default gtk theme for the GNOME 3 desktop. This Atom UI theme is
a derivative of the atom-light-ui theme that adds integration with the Adwaita
theme. Currently it changes the tab style, the scrollbars and the tree view.

## Tabs
Many current (as of 8 July 2014) distributions use older versions of the GNOME 3
desktop, which used a different, trapezoidal tab shape. I chose to use the newer
rectangular tab shape that comes with new versions of GNOME, such as the version
currently available in the official Arch Linux repositories, 3.12.
